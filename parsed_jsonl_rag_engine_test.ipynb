Further, with respect to median net worth, families that did not complete high school experienced the largest gain (60 percent).

The already substantial gap in mean net worth between families with and without a college degree widened between surveys. Median and mean net worth increased substantially for all types of families grouped by race or ethnicity between 2019 and 2022, whereby the smallest gain-in mean net worth among families that identified as other or multiple race was 12 percent. Black non-Hispanic families experienced the largest growth in both median and mean net worth—60 percent (to $44,900) and 28 percent (to $211,500), respectively-though their 2022 levels remained below all other racial or ethnic groups. Between 2019 and 2022, the median and mean net worth of renters or other non-homeowners grew 43 percent to $10,400 and 40 percent to $154,900, respectively.

Median and mean net worth increased substantially for all types of families grouped by race or ethnicity between 2019 and 2022, whereby the smallest gain-in mean net worth among families that identified as other or multiple race was 12 percent. Black non-Hispanic families experienced the largest growth in both median and mean net worth—60 percent (to $44,900) and 28 percent (to $211,500), respectively-though their 2022 levels remained below all other racial or ethnic groups. Between 2019 and 2022, the median and mean net worth of renters or other non-homeowners grew 43 percent to $10,400 and 40 percent to $154,900, respectively. Among homeowners, these measures grew 34 percent to $396,200 and 20 percent to $1,530,900, respectively. Likely reflecting the same pandemic-related forces noted earlier, families living in non-MSAs saw larger growth in median and mean net worth than those living in MSAs, somewhat narrowing the substantial gap in net worth between families by urbanicity.\\npage_span_start 20\\npage_span_end 20\"\n",

Otherwise, Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic families experienced slight decreases, and white non-Hispanic families experienced a slight increase. Mirroring the top-line changes in income, homeowners as well as renters and other non-owners experienced median and mean income growth between 2019 and 2022. Perhaps reflecting pandemic-related factors, such as migration away from cities and increased remote work, the median income gap between families living in MSAs and those living in non- MSAs narrowed considerably between 2019 and 2022, as median income surged 14 percent among families in non-MSAs and increased just 4 percent among families living in MSAs.17 How- ever, the mean income gap between the two groups widened further. For families grouped by percentile of net worth (as measured concurrently in the SCF), median and mean income growth between 2019 and 2022 were most prominent among families in the upper quartile of the distribution, driven by capital gains.
